# About this package

This JAR package comes from [the backend natives used by libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/778c936c9cc35c20ded87c2ff95252c217831963/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl/libs/gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar),
aiming to resolve the `UnsatisfiedLinkError` common for Linux platforms with newer JREs.

It contains necessary native variants for Windows, Linux and OSX, so there is no need to define multiple dependencies - Good!
